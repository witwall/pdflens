A 'lens' is (simplest example) the piece of glass in your eyeglasses or the pieces of glass in a telescope, microscope, etc.

A lens bends light to allow us to see things better.

A GUI for viewing / introspecting / modifying PDF documents is analogous to a 'lens' with which to 'see' the document better.
